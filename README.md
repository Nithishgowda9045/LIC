#Inference(Design - 2):

  1.The experiment validates that by appropriately selecting the MOSFET dimensions (L & W), 
    the drain current can be precisely controlled.

  2.The voltage transfer characteristics (VTC) helped in selecting the correct operating 
    voltage (0.8V) for saturation.

      current. Increase in width increases Id drastically and vice-versa.
    2.M1 has a smaller influence, meaning changes in its width result in only minor variations 
      in Id. Increase in qidth increases Id by small amounts and vice-versa.

    demonstrating its feasibility in practical applications.
